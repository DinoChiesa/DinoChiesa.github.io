# Tile Sliding puzzle

This is an HTML version of the tile sliding puzzle.  It has an interactive
"solve it manually" behavior. Click on a tile to move it to the open space.

What might be more interesting is that it has an auto-solver, which uses
Djikstra's A-star algorithm to find the path to solution.

What I found.

1. For a heuristic, Manhattan distance + linear conflict works better than
   simple Manhattan distance.

2. The search takes a while, with many iterations. To avoid the "this web
   page is hung" message, we need to unwrap and "asynchronize" the loop
   with setTimeout().

3. Using a string representation for the data model results in much better
   performance than using an array of integers. In Javascript anyway,
   checking for a string in the "closed" list is much faster than checking
   for the presence of an integer within an array of integers.

4. Pre-computing the adjacent tiles helps with performance too.
